	<p>
		Adrenaline is a lightweight, open-source modpack that significantly improves
		Minecraft render and logic performance through various different mods and
		configurations. You can install it on either your client or server -
		installation instructions are below.
	</p>
	<p>
		The aim of this project is to make the game run as well as possible while
		being stable enough for production use. It's default installation is very
		minimal for flexibility, so you may want to install some of your own mods
		afterwards, such as Mod Menu or Sodium Extra.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here is the <a
			href="https://github.com/skywardmc/adrenaline/wiki/Performance-features"
			>list of mods</a
		> used to improve performance. Some mods are only installed depending on the
		environment you install it in, such as a server or client. Benchmarks are not
		provided as it can significantly differ depending on device, so I'd suggest you
		try it out yourself.
	</p>
	<p>
		For more information, read through Adrenaline's <a
			href="https://modrinth.com/project/Adrenaline">Modrinth</a
		> page.
	</p>
	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>
		You can install Adrenaline through our free and open-source installer by
		clicking the button below. Alternatively, if you want to install Additive
		through a third-party launcher, or on your server, follow <a
			href="https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802250-modpacks-on-modrinth"
			>Modrinth's documentation</a
		>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Additive installer works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. If you can't open
		the installer, try running <code
			>java -jar additive-installer-1.0.3.jar</code
		> in a terminal. You need Java installed.
	</p>
	<p>
		To install Adrenaline instead of Additive in the installer, make sure that
		you uncheck "Include non-performance features". Keeping this checked will
		install Additive.
