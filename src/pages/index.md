Welcome to SkywardMC's wiki! We're a community that makes useful Minecraft modpacks, mods, tools, and more. Our most notable projects are the Adrenaline and Additive modpacks.

SkywardMC was started in 2021 by [Devin](https://github.com/intergrav) (initially known as Devin's Projects), and has slowly grown to become a larger group of people maintaining various different Minecraft-related things. If you would like to join, feel free to check out our Discord server linked above.

## Projects

Here are some of our projects. Not everything that we've made is listed here though; You can find the rest on our GitHub linked above.

- [Adrenaline](/adrenaline), a modpack that heavily improves rendering and logic performance through various different mods and configurations.
- [Additive](/additive), a modpack that provides a modern alternative to OptiFine. This is a fork of Adrenaline with added features.
