Adrenaline is a lightweight, open-source modpack that significantly improves Minecraft render and logic performance through various different mods and configurations. You can install it on either your client or server - installation instructions are below.

The aim of this project is to make the game run as well as possible while being stable enough for production use. It's default installation is very minimal for flexibility, so you may want to install some of your own mods afterwards, such as Mod Menu or Sodium Extra.

Here is the [list of mods](https://github.com/skywardmc/adrenaline/wiki/Performance-features) used to improve performance. Some mods are only installed depending on the environment you install it in, such as a server or client. Benchmarks are not provided as it can significantly differ depending on device, so I'd suggest you try it out yourself.

For more information, read through Adrenaline's [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/project/Adrenaline) page.

## Installation
